# Sport Shop

Sport Shop is a front-end web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application includes a products section, an admin section, and a settings section.

## Features

- Products section: Displays a list of sports products available for purchase. Users can view details about each product and add them to their cart.
- Admin section: Password-protected section that allows the site administrator to manage the product inventory.
- Settings section: Allows users to adjust their preferences for the site, such as changing the theme or language.

## Getting Started

To run the application, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Future Development

In the future, we plan to add a back-end to the application to enable more advanced features such as user accounts and payment processing. We may also consider implementing the application using a framework such as Vue.js to make it more modular and scalable.
